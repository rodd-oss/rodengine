We want to build relational in memory database. It would be used for online games.

Without any SQL support, but with rest API for
- creating / deleting tables by name
- creating / deleting table fields by name and type from predefined type list
- creating / deleting relations
- crud operations for records
- RPC call

Requirements_start
- it should support relations for all tables
- table storage should be a vec<u8> and perform unsafe casting user of defined fields to its storage
- zero copy and minimum allocations
- fields in one record should be tightly packed together for CPU cache friendliness
- records in a table should be tightly packed to each other for CPU cache friendliness
- each crud operation should be atomic and without mutex locks
- it should use atomic transactions by default
- it should be able to perform all operations in memory, and save changes on disk in parallel
- it should be able to save its scheme in a json file
- it should be able to support default DB data types and additional types such as 3xf32 for vector representation etc
- db should support parallel read and write operations by using arc swap on the buffers
- DB runtime should have its own loop with a specified tickrate. in that loop database runs its handlers such as API calls, custom procedures etc
- tickrate from 15 hz to 120hz.
- procedure should be able to itter parallel on all available CPU cores on the data in one table to maximize cache hit
- each procedure should run transactionaly and commit at the end
